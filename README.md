### COORDINATION APP:
https://trello.com/b/Q4gxKaU5/tfg

### MODELS:
- **User:** model made to contain the client data.
- **User prediction:** model that contains all the data related to the user prediction, How long did it take the user to perform the test?, How many times did the user press the Key-Back?, How many times did the user press the Key-Space?, ...

### USER TYPES:
- **Guest User:** Unregistered users will be able to navigate throughout the web page to see the app but, they wont be allowed to make the prediction (This template will be hide for this users).
- **Registered user:** The registered user will be able to perform everything the guest user can do, plus being able to make the prediction (This template will be showed to the registered users).
- **Admin:** He will be able perform everything the registered user can do, but he can also add, modify or delete users, and users predictions.


### ALGORITHM:
The app will be able to find out which user is typing once the prediction has been made. 3 base cases must be loaded so that, the first user to register in the app can carry out the prediction test with more cases analyzed apart from their own.
